### Paytm-clone by Ritik Kumar
I cloned the unicorn in just 8 hrs with the help of tailwind CSS. Just kidding ðŸ¤“. <br>
Last week I learned vanilla css, Responsive Layout, flexbox, and grid. Now It was time to learn Tailwind CSS( mobile-first utility-first CSS framework) learning curve was so easy that I picked it up in a couple of hours. 
I tried to create this landing page with the help of tailwind classes. The first time I followed the mobile-first approach. The challenge I faced during building the project was remembering the utility class name. I took help from the docs very often.
